## Decisions governing `sandboxes/base/`

### S-0121/D-9 — `LOCKED` (Charter) — implementation: partial

Every sandbox image answers `/opt/torve/equip` and `/opt/torve/run`, and the engine talks to it only through flat `TORVE_*` scalars in its own vocabulary; brokered and direct runs differ only in values, no manifest carries a shell line, and a seat's `env` reaches the image as written with nothing under `src/` reading it

- Paths: `src/torve/adapters/agent/harness.py` `src/torve/config/agents.py` `sandboxes/base/**` `sandboxes/claude/**` `sandboxes/dsh/**`
- Check: `uv run pytest tests/test_sandbox_defs.py -k "seam or broker"` (shadow; runs as `decision:S-0121/D-9`, no log entry owed)
