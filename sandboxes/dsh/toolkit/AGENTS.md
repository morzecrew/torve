## Decisions governing `sandboxes/dsh/toolkit/`

### S-0066/D-1 — `LOCKED` (An attempt's inputs are declared, and the image says what it loaded)

A sandbox attempt's inputs are what its profile declared; the files the worktree carries for other readers — `.mcp.json`, `.claude/skills`, `.agents/skills`, `AGENTS.md` — are shut out by each image's own switch

- Paths: `sandboxes/claude/toolkit/run` `sandboxes/dsh/toolkit/run` `sandboxes/mimo/toolkit/run`
- Consequence: the regime digest means what it claims, so two attempts recorded under one digest saw one set of inputs; a session is unaffected, because it makes no such claim
- Touching these paths owes a divergence entry: `torve log owed <task> --touched <files>` before you finish

### S-0066/D-3 — `ASSUMED` (An attempt's inputs are declared, and the image says what it loaded)

Each image emits a machine-readable trace whose last line is still the result envelope the engine parses, so the burn parser is fed without moving the seam

- Paths: `sandboxes/claude/toolkit/run` `sandboxes/dsh/toolkit/report-usage` `sandboxes/mimo/toolkit/run`
- Consequence: `parse_burn` produces its first profile in the engine's history, and the per-turn and per-tool facts every later seat comparison needs start being recorded
