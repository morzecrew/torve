"""Supporting tool for the gitmoji-conventional skill: validate commit messages.

Checks a message against `<gitmoji> <type>[scope][!]: <description>` — including
the emoji↔type pairing, which it reads from `references/gitmoji-mapping.md` so the
reference stays the single source of truth instead of being restated in code.

  --file PATH        validate one message file (the commit-msg hook shape)
  --message TEXT     validate a literal message
  --range REV..REV   validate every commit in a git range (audit a branch)
  (no input flag)    read the message from stdin

Checks:
  C1  subject matches the format
  C2  the emoji is an official gitmoji
  C3  the type is the one that gitmoji maps to (💥 rides any type)
  C4  💥 / `!` / `BREAKING CHANGE:` agree with each other
  C5  `BREAKING CHANGE` is uppercase and its continuation lines are indented
  C6  description is imperative-ish and unpunctuated
  C7  a body is separated from the subject by a blank line
  C8  the body is not an essay (hard cap on its length)
  C9  the body is short enough to read at a glance (soft cap)
  C10 body lines are wrapped

Subject length is reported as a warning, not a failure: the skill's cap is
"<= 72 characters when possible", and a validator should not harden a rule its
skill deliberately hedged.

C8 is a hard failure and the caps are not taste. Measured over this
repository's own history when the rule was added: median body 9 non-blank
lines, 96% at or under 15, exactly one commit over 20. The hard cap sits at
that ceiling so honest history keeps passing, because a check that is red over
good data teaches everyone to ignore it. What it stops is the failure mode it
was written for — agent-written bodies that narrate a working session instead
of explaining a change, which ran 22-29 lines apiece.

The one historical commit it fails is a batched fix carrying six unrelated
stories, which "one commit, one semantic story" already discourages; the cap
was not widened to admit it. Raising the cap by four lines would have let two
of the three essays that prompted this rule straight through, which is the
whole argument against tuning a limit until the thing that caught you passes.

Footers and fenced code blocks are excluded from both caps. That makes a
fence the declared way to carry bulk a body genuinely needs (a stack trace, a
failing config, a benchmark table), and it is a speed bump rather than a lock:
prose hidden inside a fence would pass. It would also be plainly visible to
the next reader, which is the point.

Merge, fixup!, squash! and revert-generated messages are skipped — git writes
those, not you.

Exit codes: 0 clean (warnings allowed) · 1 usage/IO error · 2 failures found.
Unknown flags also exit 2, from argparse itself — check stderr to tell that
apart from a failing commit message.

Install as a hook (this is the skill at rung 3 — see `ratchet-what-you-build`):
