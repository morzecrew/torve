"""Supporting tool for the rfc-writer skill: allocate numbers and keep INDEX.md honest.

  check   validate the collection — index rows vs files (both directions),
          filename number vs H1 number, header status vs table status,
          duplicate numbers, and whether the claimed next-free number is free
  next    print the next free number (max existing + 1), zero-padded
  new     allocate the number, write NNNN-kebab-title.md from the skill's
          template, append the index row, and bump the next-free number

`check` and `next` are read-only. `new` writes two files (the RFC and the index).

The directory is discovered as rfcs/ or rfc/ under --root (default: cwd); the
index is INDEX.md, or README.md where a collection already uses it. Statuses are
compared by their emoji, since the prose after it carries free-form annotations
("✅ Complete — shipped 2026-06-29; only P5 remains").

Exit codes: 0 ok · 1 usage/IO error · 2 check found problems. Unknown flags exit
2, from argparse itself.

Everything this tool does is mechanical. Which number a design deserves, what
the one-liner says, and when a status changes stay in SKILL.md.
