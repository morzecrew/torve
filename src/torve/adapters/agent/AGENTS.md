## Decisions governing `src/torve/adapters/agent/`

### D-55.33 — `ASSUMED` (RFC 0055 — Standing decisions)

Configuration routes by nature — identity in the image, task context in the workspace, secrets as environment names, knobs in the command, state on the slot volume — one item, one channel

- Paths: `src/torve/config/runconfig.py` `src/torve/adapters/agent/harness.py`
- Consequence: A second channel for a secret is a leak; a repository-carried harness config is an injection surface

### D-55.60 — `ASSUMED` (RFC 0055 — Standing decisions)

Every attempt runs on a worktree seeded with the base sha pinned host-side, the role's skills materialised, and the divergence log seeded; the session trace is captured to `.torve/traces/` and its content enters no prompt and drives no control flow

- Paths: `src/torve/application/session.py` `src/torve/adapters/agent/harness.py` `.torve/traces/**`
- Consequence: What an agent saw is reconstructible; what it reasoned is never an input to another agent
